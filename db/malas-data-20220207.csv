"create a CUSTOM mala - cost includes shipping, consultation, design time and beads","I love working with people to create custom mala designs! You can choose your beads, cord, tassel and we can work together to find just the right design to bring the energy and intentions you want to invite into your life to help you raise your vibe. The cost covers beads, materials, time, and shipping.


PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING
Terms and conditions apply to custom mala creations. 

I can communicate with you through various channels/ platform options to be mututally determined by both parties. Options include phone calls, email, text, Etsy messages, FaceTime, Zoom, or Marco Polo. 

In brief, here is how the custom mala creation process works: 

1) Provide information on which colors/types of stones you are interested in or which types of energies you would like to include - e.g. grounding, balancing, uplifting, calming, energizing, etc. If you have a particular deadline you are trying to meet please let me know up front. 

2) I most likely will need to place an order to purchase your beads since I may not have the beads in stock you are looking for. If I do need to place an order, I will send you pictures of the beads so you can approve before ordered. 

3) By this time I should have an idea of what type of design/bead layout you are interested in. Once all beads are acquired I will lay out 2 - 3 design options and send pictures/ video.  

4) I’m happy to go back and forth a few times to get the design just right for you. If it requires more than 5 additional design ideations I may need to add an additional design fee. I will be upfront in communicating this with you, there will be no hidden fees or surprises. 

5) When you have selected a final design I will string the beads onto the cord without knotting and send more pictures/video. 
After you confirm this final design I will begin hand knotting your mala. 

The entire process from design to your mailbox usually takes 1 - 4 weeks depending on a few factors including how quickly beads can be sourced and how quickly the design is decided.
